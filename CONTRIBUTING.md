# Contributing
Hello there! Welcome to my FANDOM code repository. Where it's usually made to store codes for the Dev Wiki, or some Wikia.css codes.

## Editing
You are free to edit the codes here, but not big edits that either changes how they look, or even break them. If you find any issue, don't be shy and create a pull request! But if you are truly shy, just create a new issue for contributors of this repository to fix.

If you have any issues, just mention the username @Headquarter8302

## Guidelines
Some of these codes are used in major projects, such as wikis and scripts used for them:

1. No useless code addition.
2. No harmful code addition.
3. Obfuscation is disallowed, but minification is recommended.
4. Depolyment of files and scripts are on per request, so no direct commit to the main branch.

That is all, thanks for reading the Contribution guidelines!
